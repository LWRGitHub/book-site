# The Midnight Dream Publishing
This is a React.js website for my Amazon KDP project. I Orchestrated the publication of 10+ ebooks on Amazon including paper & Audible publication of books. Gave ideas & directed ghostwriters in realizing those ideas as published works. Designed eight covers. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability & function.  Making interfaces in software or computerized devices with a focus on looks or style.
